# Contributing

## Branching Model

- `main`: stable/demo-ready branch, pull requests only.
- `dev`: integration branch, pull requests preferred with lighter review rules.
- Create feature branches from `dev` (or from `main` if `dev` does not exist).
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Use Squash merge (recommended) to keep history clean.

## Branch Naming Convention

Use:

- `<type>/<short-title>`

Allowed types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `chore`
- `docs`
- `refactor`
- `test`

Examples:

- `feat/project-crud`
- `fix/login-redirect`
- `docs/error-handling-contract`
- `chore/update-gitignore`

## Commit Message Convention

Use:

- `feat: ...`
- `fix: ...`
- `chore: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `refactor: ...`
- `test: ...`

Keep messages short and meaningful.

## Local Verification

- Before PR, run `npm run verify` and `npm test`.
- `verify` runs: `format:check`, `lint`, and `typecheck`.
- `npm test` runs the full unit test suite — must exit 0.

## Artifacts Never to Commit

- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `target/`
- `.env` (use `.env.example` when needed)
- IDE files:
  - `.idea/`
  - `.vscode/`

## PR Expectations

- Keep pull requests small and focused (single purpose).
- Require at least 1 approval before merge (aligned with branch protection settings).
- Clearly describe what changed and how it was tested locally.

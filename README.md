# ResearchTrack Frontend

React + Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend for ResearchTrack.

Current scope covers the public landing flow, auth screens, student workspace, and supervisor workspace with backend-connected project, GitHub integration, and Jira analytics flows (Health, Sprint Progress, and Team Workload) including the Jira OAuth callback route.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS (see `.nvmrc`)
- npm (project standard package manager)

### Environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Use backend-aligned local values.

Default example:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_API_VERSION=v1
```

GitHub App setup/install links are now backend-managed via `GITHUB_APP_INSTALL_URL`
in the backend environment.

Local auth/refresh reliability notes:

- Ensure the backend gateway runs on `http://localhost:5000` and frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to that gateway origin.
- Set `VITE_API_VERSION` to the API contract exposed by the gateway/backend, for example `v1`.
- Ensure backend `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173`.
- Use `localhost` consistently in FE and BE (do not mix with `127.0.0.1`).

Docker/CI note:

- Pass both `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_API_VERSION` as build arguments.
- Example:
  `docker build --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://stg.researchtrack.blipzo.xyz --build-arg VITE_API_VERSION=v1 .`
- FE container-level gzip compression is configured in `nginx.conf` for text assets (`gzip_min_length 1024`).
- If Nginx Proxy Manager also applies compression, keep only one compression layer active to avoid redundant work.

### Install and Run

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run dev`

## API versioning

Both the gateway origin and API contract version are environment-controlled:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_API_VERSION=v1
```

Feature modules remain version-agnostic and use logical paths such as `/api/auth/register`. The shared API client inserts `VITE_API_VERSION` at the network boundary, so the actual request becomes:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/register
```

`VITE_API_VERSION` must use the form `v<number>` (for example `v1` or `v2`). The application validates it during Vite startup/build and again in runtime configuration. Feature code must not hard-code `/api/v1/...` or any other versioned path.

Changing API version therefore requires only environment/deployment configuration, while the React feature code remains unchanged. The configured version must still match a version actually exposed by the gateway/backend.


## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` - Run type checks and create production build.
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build.
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint across `src` and fail on errors.
- `npm run format` - Format project files with Prettier.
- `npm run format:check` - Check formatting and fail if files are not formatted.
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript checks with no emit.
- `npm run verify` - Run `format:check`, `lint`, and `typecheck` in sequence.
- `npm test` - Run all unit tests with Vitest (single run).
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode.

### Common Commands

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run verify`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`

## Pre-PR Verification

Before commit/PR, run:

```
npm run verify
npm test
```

`verify` checks formatting, linting, and type safety. If formatting fails, run `npm run format` and rerun `npm run verify`. `npm test` runs the full unit test suite and must exit 0.

## Contributing / Workflow

For branching rules, PR expectations, and local verification steps, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions are configured for `develop` and `main`.

- Pull requests to `develop` and `main` run formatting, linting, type checking, unit tests, production build, and Docker image build.
- Pushes to `develop` represent the Test deployment candidate.
- Pushes to `main` represent the Production deployment candidate.
- Deployment jobs use GitHub Environments named `test` and `production`; provider-specific deployment commands can be added after hosting credentials are configured.

For the full branch and release policy, see `docs/devops/branching-strategy.md`.

## Package Manager Standard

- Use `npm` only.
- Commit `package-lock.json` with dependency changes.
- Do not add `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or other lockfiles.

## Folder Structure

- `src/app` - App-level routing, shared layouts (`AppShell`, `PublicLayout`), providers, and guards.
- `src/features` - Feature-based modules (`landing`, `auth`, `student`, `supervisor`).
- `src/components` - Shared UI, brand, and feedback components.
- `src/services` - Shared service modules (for example, API client and token storage).
- `src/lib` - Shared utility modules.
- `src/styles` - Global styles and shared animation utilities.
- `src/types` - Shared types.

## Current UI Scope

- Public routes are implemented for `/`, `/login`, and `/register`.
- Student UI routes are implemented for `/student`, `/student/projects`, and `/student/projects/:projectId`.
- Supervisor UI routes are implemented for `/supervisor`, `/supervisor/dashboard`, `/supervisor/projects`, `/supervisor/projects/new`, and `/supervisor/projects/:projectId`.
- Public GitHub callback routes are implemented for `/github/request-access` and `/github/access-updated`.
- Legacy aliases (`/dashboard`, `/project`, `/project/new`, `/project/:projectId`, `/projects`, `/projects/new`, `/projects/:projectId`) redirect into the correct student or supervisor route based on the stored user.
- Student and supervisor routes share the same top-bar shell (`AppShell` + `TopBar`) and the same shared button system.
- Student project list/detail and supervisor dashboard/list/detail/create flows are backend-connected.
- Supervisor GitHub flow supports backend-managed setup start, installation-level access authorization, explicit repository selection, and repository link/remove management.
- Supervisor Jira flow supports workspace connection via Atlassian OAuth and health analytics display (see [Jira Integration](#jira-integration) below).
- Some advanced workflow panels (for example meetings/files/action-items as full modules) remain out of scope or partially mock-derived until dedicated APIs are added.
- Route guards support a UI-only cross-role preview mode in local development. This is not a security boundary and must be enforced by the backend.

## Jira Integration

The Jira feature is supervisor-only. It consists of two main parts:

**OAuth callback route**

- Route: `/supervisor/jira/callback`
- Handled by `JiraOAuthCallbackPage`.
- The backend initiates the Atlassian OAuth flow from the Integrations tab. After the supervisor authorizes access in Atlassian, the browser is redirected to this route with a `code` and `state` parameter. The frontend exchanges these with the backend to complete the connection.
- This redirect URI must exactly match `ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI` set in the backend `.env`.

**Jira tab (project detail)**

- Entry point: `JiraTabSection` → `JiraHealthOverview`.
- Shown only when `project.jira.connected === true`; otherwise displays a prompt to connect from the Integrations tab.
- `JiraHealthOverview` fetches analytics data via `supervisorApi.getJiraHealth`, `supervisorApi.getJiraSprintProgress`, and `supervisorApi.getJiraWorkload`, and exposes a manual refresh action via `supervisorApi.refreshProjectJira`.

**Jira health components** (all in `src/features/supervisor/components/ProjectDetail/jira/`):

| `JiraHealthSkeleton`        | Loading skeleton for the full Jira tab                                                                                  |

## UI Architecture Notes

- `TopBar` is the single navigation shell for public and authenticated layouts.
- `Button.tsx` is the single source of truth for button variants, sizing, and states.
- `PageHeader`, `PageTabs`, `StatusBadge`, `Card`, and `EmptyState` are shared primitives used across landing, student, and supervisor pages.
- The landing page is treated as a public page inside the same design system, not a separate marketing site.

## Documentation

- Overview index: `docs/README.md`
- Feature guides: `docs/features/*.md`
- Branch/fix docs: `docs/branches/*.md` (including SCRUM-80, SCRUM-81, SCRUM-97 major-fixes)
- Shared UI notes: `docs/ui/*.md`

## Note

The repository standard is to keep local checks green before commit or PR. Run `npm run verify` after UI changes so formatting, linting, and type checks stay aligned with project expectations.

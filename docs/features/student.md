# Student Feature

Student workspace for browsing assigned projects and reading project detail.

## Routes

| Path | Component | Layout |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `/student` | Redirect to `/student/projects` | `StudentLayout` |
| `/student/projects` | `StudentProjectsPage` | `StudentLayout` |
| `/student/projects/:projectId` | `StudentProjectDetailsPage` | `StudentLayout` |

## Route Behavior

- Protected by `RequireRole("STUDENT")`.
- Legacy aliases (`/project`, `/projects`, `/project/:projectId`) resolve into student routes for non-supervisor stored users.
- Guard behavior remains UI-level only; backend authorization is the security boundary.

- `GET /api/v1/projects`
- `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}`

## Projects List (`/student/projects`)

### Data source

- Uses `useStudentProjects`
- Calls `GET /api/v1/projects`
- Revalidates the collection whenever the Student project home mounts so membership additions/removals are reflected without relying on a long-lived in-memory list cache.

### Current card behavior

- Full card click opens `/student/projects/:projectId`
- Status + progress shown in compact top row
- Long text fields are truncated with tooltip fallback
- Legacy action footer buttons removed

### Search/filter behavior

- Local search by title/summary/supervisor/batch/semester
- Uses deferred query for responsive typing

### UX states

- Loading: `StudentProjectCardSkeleton`
- Error: `ErrorState` with retry
- Empty with no assignments: dedicated `No research project assigned yet` state with Refresh action.
- Empty after search: `No projects found` state with Clear search action.

---

## Project Detail (`/student/projects/:projectId`)

### Data source

- Uses `useStudentProject`
- Calls `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}`
- Revalidates project access whenever the detail route mounts so a removed membership cannot be represented by stale cached detail data.

### Tabs

- `Overview`
- `Team`
- `Milestones`
- `Files`
- `GitHub`
- `Jira`
- `Meetings`

### Header chips

- Status chip aligned with milestone/team/progress pills
- Metadata chips are read-only for student role

### Detail sections

- Overview:
  - batch, semester, health note, primary milestone summary
- Team:
  - assigned member cards (name/email/member role/registration number)
  - Supervisor is rendered before Student members for a stable role hierarchy.
  - Leader identity is kept in the project model but is not repeated as a disruptive badge inside the generic member-card list.
- Milestones:
  - milestone list with sequence, status, due date, description
- GitHub (read-only shared dashboard):
  - uses same layout/components as supervisor GitHub tab
  - shows repository overview, activity summary, contributors preview, activity preview
  - supports paginated full-list modals for commits/contributors
  - no add/edit/remove/refresh controls are rendered for students
  - when no repository is linked, shows a read-only CTA to navigate to Overview tab guidance
- Jira (read-only shared analytics view):
  - Renders the same `JiraHealthOverview` orchestrator used by supervisors.
  - Sub-tabs: Health, Sprint Progress (4 most recent), Team Workload, and Hierarchy.
  - Fetches data via `GET /api/student/projects/{projectId}/jira/*` endpoints.
  - No manual refresh or connect/disconnect actions are exposed for students.
  - When Jira is not connected, displays a read-only empty state.
- Meetings:
  - Inner sub-tabs use Jira-style pill navigation with `role="tablist"`:
    - `Channels`
    - `Records`
  - `Channels` fetches and renders `GET /api/student/projects/{projectId}/meeting-channels`.
  - Students can submit channels via `POST /api/student/projects/{projectId}/meeting-channels`.
  - Student-submitted channels are shown as pending until supervisor approval.
  - No student edit/delete/approve actions are exposed.
  - `Records` fetches and renders `GET /api/student/projects/{projectId}/meeting-records`.
  - Students can submit records via `POST /api/student/projects/{projectId}/meeting-records`.
  - Student-submitted records are shown as pending until supervisor approval.
  - Student records are view-only after submission (no edit/delete/approve actions are exposed).

### Files (student scope)

- Data source:
  - Primary seed from `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}` via embedded `data.files`.
  - Refresh/list endpoint: `GET /api/student/projects/{projectId}/files`.
- Upload flow:
  - `POST /files/upload-url` -> direct S3 PUT -> `POST /files/confirm`.
  - On success, UI inserts returned file row without immediate list re-fetch.
- Download flow:
  - `GET /files/{fileId}/download-url`, then browser opens pre-signed URL.
- Delete behavior:
  - No student delete action is available in UI or API.
- Validation/config:
  - Uses backend-provided `files.config` (`maxFileSizeBytes`, `maxFileNameLength`, `allowedTypes`, `presignedUrlExpirySeconds`).

### Jira - Hierarchy tab

Displays all cached Jira issues in an expandable tree grouped by Epic -> Story/Task/Bug -> Subtask.

- Collapsed by default beyond depth 2.
- Each node shows: issue type badge, issue key, summary, status pill, assignee, and story points.
- "Unlinked Issues" section shows issues whose parent is outside the project's cache.
- Source: `GET /api/student/projects/{projectId}/jira/hierarchy`
- Hook: `useStudentJiraHierarchy`
- Components: `JiraHierarchyView`, `JiraHierarchyNode`, `JiraHierarchySkeleton`

Jira tab data rules come from backend analytics configuration (no student-side overrides).

### UX states

- Loading: `StudentProjectDetailsSkeleton`
- API errors: `ErrorState`
- `NOT_FOUND`: dedicated project-not-found screen with back link

---

## Notes

- `/student/projects` is the Student Sprint 1 home/dashboard surface; it intentionally reuses the canonical role-aware Project Service read model rather than introducing a duplicate Student dashboard backend.
- Student list and detail routes are backend-connected.
- Student mock project seed data is removed from active list/detail rendering.
- GitHub tab is always present in detail tabs, but displays role-safe empty state when no repository is linked.
- Jira tab is always present in detail tabs and remains read-only for students.
